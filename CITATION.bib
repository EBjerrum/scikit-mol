	abstract = {Scikit-Mol is a open-source toolkit that aims to bridge the gap between two well-established toolkits, RDKit and Scikit-Learn, in order to provide a simple interface for building cheminformatics models. By leveraging the strengths of both RDKit and Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Mol provides a powerful platform for creating predictive modeling in drug discovery and materials design. Unlike other toolkits that often integrate both chemistry and machine learning, Scikit-Mol rather aims to be a simple bridge between the two, reducing the maintenance effort required to keep up with changes and new features in e.g. Scikit-Learn. A simple example of Scikit-Mol's functionality is provided, demonstrating its compatibility with Scikit-Learn pipelines. Overall, Scikit-Mol provides a useful and flexible package for building self-contained and self-documented cheminformatics models with minimal maintenance required.},
