    The convex hull approach determines if a point belongs to the convex hull of the
    training set by checking if it can be represented as a convex combination of
    training points.

    The method is based on the `highs` solver from the `scipy.optimize` module, but is still
    slow at inference time.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    points_ : ndarray of shape (n_features + 1, n_samples)
        Transformed training points used for convex hull calculations.

        y : Ignored
