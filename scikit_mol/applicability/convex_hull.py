    """Applicability domain defined as the convex hull of the training data.

    The convex hull approach determines if a point belongs to the convex hull of the
    training set by checking if it can be represented as a convex combination of
    training points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    percentile : float or None, default=None
        Not used, present for API consistency.
    feature_name : str, default="ConvexHull"
        Prefix for feature names in output.

    Notes
    -----
    The method is based on the `highs` solver from `scipy.optimize`. Note that this
    method can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional data or large
    training sets, as it requires solving a linear programming problem for each
    test point.

    For high-dimensional data (e.g., fingerprints), consider using dimensionality
    reduction before applying this method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    points_ : ndarray of shape (n_features + 1, n_samples)
        Transformed training points used for convex hull calculations.
    threshold_ : float
        Fixed at 0.5 since output is binary (inside/outside hull).
