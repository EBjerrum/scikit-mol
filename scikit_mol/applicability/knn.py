class KNNApplicabilityDomain(BaseApplicabilityDomain):
    """Applicability domain defined using K-nearest neighbors.

    Determines domain membership based on the mean distance to k nearest neighbors
    in the training set. Higher distances indicate samples further from the
    training distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors to use for distance calculation.
    percentile : float or None, default=None
        Percentile of training set distances to use as threshold (0-100).
        If None, uses 99.0 (include 99% of training samples).
    distance_metric : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        Distance metric to use. As examples:
        - 'euclidean': Euclidean distance (default)
        - 'manhattan': Manhattan distance
        - 'cosine': Cosine distance
        - 'tanimoto': Tanimoto distance for binary fingerprints (same as 'jaccard')
        - 'jaccard': Jaccard distance for binary fingerprints
        - callable: Custom distance metric function(X, Y) -> array-like
        Any distance metric supported by sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors can also be used.
        Note: Only distance metrics are supported (higher values = more distant) currently.
    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context.
        -1 means using all processors.
    feature_name : str, default='KNN'
        Prefix for feature names in output.

    Notes
    -----
    For binary fingerprints, the Tanimoto distance is equivalent to the Jaccard distance.
    Both 'tanimoto' and 'jaccard' options use scipy's implementation of the Jaccard
    distance metric.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    threshold_ : float
        Distance threshold for domain membership.
    nn_ : NearestNeighbors
        Fitted nearest neighbors model.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scikit_mol.applicability import KNNApplicabilityDomain
    >>>
    >>> # Generate example data
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> X_train = rng.normal(0, 1, (100, 5))
    >>> X_test = rng.normal(0, 2, (20, 5))  # More spread out than training
    >>>
    >>> # Fit AD model
    >>> ad = KNNApplicabilityDomain(n_neighbors=5, percentile=95)
    >>> ad.fit(X_train)
    >>>
    >>> # Get raw distance scores (higher = more distant)
    >>> distances = ad.transform(X_test)
    >>>
    >>> # Get domain membership predictions
    >>> predictions = ad.predict(X_test)  # 1 = inside, -1 = outside
    >>>
    >>> # Get probability-like scores
    >>> scores = ad.score_transform(X_test)  # Higher = more likely inside
