    """Applicability domain defined using K-nearest neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors to use for distance calculation.
    percentile : float, default=99
        Percentile of training set distances to use as threshold.
        Samples with distances above this percentile are considered outside
        the applicability domain. The fit_threshold method can be used to update
        the threshold using new data without refitting the model (e.g. validation data).
    metric : str, default='euclidean'
        Distance metric to use for nearest neighbor calculation.
        Any metric supported by sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors can be used.
    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context.
        -1 means using all processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    threshold_ : float
        Distance threshold for the applicability domain.
    nn_ : NearestNeighbors
        Fitted nearest neighbors model.
