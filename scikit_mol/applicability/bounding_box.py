    """Applicability domain defined by feature value ranges.

    Samples falling outside the allowed range for any feature are considered
    outside the domain. The range for each feature is defined by percentiles
    of the training set distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    percentile : float or tuple of float, default=(0.1, 99.9)
        Percentile(s) of the training set distribution used to define
        the bounding box. If float, uses (percentile, 100-percentile).
    feature_name : str, default="BoundingBox"
        Prefix for feature names in output.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    min_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Minimum allowed value for each feature.
    max_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Maximum allowed value for each feature.
    threshold_ : float
        Current threshold for domain membership (always 0.5).

    Notes
    -----
    The bounding box method is simple but effective, especially for chemical
    descriptors with clear physical interpretations. For high-dimensional or
    correlated features, other methods may be more appropriate.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    >>> from scikit_mol.applicability import BoundingBoxApplicabilityDomain
    >>>
    >>> # Basic usage
    >>> ad = BoundingBoxApplicabilityDomain(percentile=1)
    >>> ad.fit(X_train)
    >>> predictions = ad.predict(X_test)
    >>>
    >>> # With preprocessing
    >>> pipe = make_pipeline(
    ...     StandardScaler(),
    ...     BoundingBoxApplicabilityDomain(percentile=1)
    ... )
    >>> pipe.fit(X_train)
    >>> predictions = pipe.predict(X_test)
