    """Applicability domain based on Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

    LOF measures the local deviation of density of a sample with respect to its
    neighbors, identifying samples that have substantially lower density than
    their neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=20
        Number of neighbors to use for LOF calculation.
    contamination : float, default=0.1
        Expected proportion of outliers in the data set.
    metric : str, default='euclidean'
        Metric to use for distance computation.
    percentile : float or None, default=None
        Percentile of training set scores to use as threshold (0-100).
        If None, uses contamination-based threshold from LOF.
    feature_name : str, default="LOF"
        Name for the output feature column.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    lof_ : LocalOutlierFactor
        Fitted LOF estimator.
    threshold_ : float
        Current threshold for domain membership.

    Notes
    -----
    The scoring convention is 'high_outside' because higher LOF scores
    indicate samples that are more likely to be outliers.
