class LeverageApplicabilityDomain(BaseApplicabilityDomain):
    """Applicability domain defined using the leverage approach.

    The leverage approach measures how far a sample is from the center of the
    feature space using the diagonal elements of the hat matrix H = X(X'X)^(-1)X'.
    Higher leverage values indicate samples further from the center of the training data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold_factor : float, default=3
        Factor used in calculating the leverage threshold h* = threshold_factor * (p+1)/n
        where p is the number of features and n is the number of samples.
    percentile : float or None, default=None
        If not None, overrides the statistical threshold with a percentile-based one.
        See BaseApplicabilityDomain for details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    threshold_ : float
        Calculated leverage threshold.
    var_covar_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Variance-covariance matrix of the training data.

    Notes
    -----
    The statistical threshold h* = 3 * (p+1)/n is a commonly used rule of thumb
    in regression diagnostics, where p is the number of features and n is the
    number of training samples.

    Input data should be scaled (e.g., using StandardScaler) to ensure all features
    contribute equally. For high-dimensional data like fingerprints, dimensionality
    reduction (e.g., PCA) is strongly recommended to avoid computational issues with
    the variance-covariance matrix inversion.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    >>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    >>> from scikit_mol.applicability import LeverageApplicabilityDomain
    >>>
    >>> # Create pipeline with scaling and dimensionality reduction
    >>> pipe = Pipeline([
    ...     ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ...     ('pca', PCA(n_components=0.95)),  # Keep 95% of variance
    ...     ('ad', LeverageApplicabilityDomain())
    ... ])
    >>>
    >>> # Fit pipeline
    >>> X_train = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]]  # Example data
    >>> pipe.fit(X_train)
    >>>
    >>> # Predict domain membership for new samples
    >>> X_test = [[0, 1, 2], [10, 20, 30]]
    >>> pipe.predict(X_test)  # Returns [1, -1] (in/out of domain)
