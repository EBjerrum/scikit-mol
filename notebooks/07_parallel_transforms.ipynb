    "Interestingly, we observed that parallelism actually took longer to calculate the fingerprints in some cases, which is a perfect illustration of the overhead issue associated with parallelism. Generally, the faster the fingerprint calculation in itself, the larger the dataset needs to be for parallelism to be worthwhile. For example, the Descriptor transformer, which is one of the slowest, can benefit even for smaller datasets, while for faster fingerprint types like Morgan, Atompairs, and Topological Torsion fingerprints, the dataset needs to be larger.\n",

These timings were taken on a 16 core machine (32 Hyperthreads). Only the largest datasets (>10,000 samples) would make it worthwhile to parallelize Morgan, Atompairs, and Topological Torsions. SECfingerprint, MACCS keys, and RDKitFP are intermediate and would benefit from parallelism when the dataset size is larger, say >500. Descriptors, on the other hand, benefit almost immediately even for the smallest datasets (>100 samples).\n",
